# How sound wave sources' motion can be recognised from the excitation of the medium around it 

Model that produces a medium topography for a sound wave source in motion 
reverse engineering can be achieved by comparing your result with a given portfolio of topography's that are the result of characteristic types of motion: eg. cicular motion,
